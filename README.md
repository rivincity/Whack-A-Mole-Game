# Whack-A-Mole-Game
A Harry-Potter themed version of the popular game "Whack-A-Mole"

Home screen displays a button that will start the game. 

Players will have 60 seconds to click on as many "Voldemort" moles as they can. For each mole they click, a miniature version of the mole will be instantiated at the top of the screen so players can keep track of how many moles they have hit. Each mole increases in size as it spawns in and then changes its photo to signify that it is no longer clickable. At the bottom of the screen, the score as well as the number of moles missed will be displayed. There is a special mole which adds 5 seconds and a danger mole which reduces the score. Once the game ends, the app will load a game over screen which displays statistics about the player's performance.
